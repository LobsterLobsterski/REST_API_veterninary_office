# Vet Office REST API

Welcome to the Vet Office REST API project! This Spring Boot application provides a comprehensive solution for managing a veterinary clinic's operations, including appointments, patient records, and veterinary staff information. Whether you're a veterinarian, a pet owner, or a developer interested in veterinary care systems, this project demonstrates the power of Spring Boot in building a RESTful API for a vet office.

## Features

- **Appointment Management:** Schedule, reschedule, and cancel appointments for pets, ensuring efficient utilization of the vet's time.
- **Patient Records:** Maintain detailed records for each pet, including medical history, vaccinations, and previous treatments.
- **Staff Information:** Manage information about veterinarians, technicians, and support staff, ensuring a well-organized clinic environment.
- **Payment and Invoicing:** Record payments for services rendered and generate invoices for pet owners.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Secure endpoints with authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive patient data.
- **Swagger Documentation:** Explore the API endpoints and operations easily through Swagger documentation.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot:** A robust and flexible framework for building Java-based enterprise applications.
- **Spring Data JPA:** Simplifies data access and persistence using Java Persistence API (JPA).
- **Spring Security:** Provides authentication, authorization, and protection against common security vulnerabilities.
- **Swagger:** Generates interactive API documentation for easy exploration and testing.
- **Database:** Utilizes a relational database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store patient and appointment data securely.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vet-office-api.git
2. **Configure the Database:**
- Set up your database configuration in `application.properties` or `application.yml`.
- Run database migrations and seed initial data if necessary.
3. **Build and Run the Application:**
./mvnw spring-boot:run

4. **Explore the API:**
- Access Swagger documentation at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html` to understand and test available endpoints.
- Use tools like Postman or `curl` commands for API testing.

## Authentication

To access protected endpoints, obtain an access token by authenticating with valid credentials. Implement authentication mechanisms like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure communication between the client and the server.
